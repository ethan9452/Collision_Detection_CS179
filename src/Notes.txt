Simulation Specifications
	Particles are created in a box. The box has dimensions box_x X box_y, and
	all the points are positive (box is on 1st quadrant of Cartesian plane).


Input Format: 
	Array of Particle structs


Output Format:
	2D array of dimension num_partices X num_particles. 
	arr[x,y] = 1 when the particles indexed by x and y collide, 
	0 otherwise:

	eg: if the collisions are (0,1), (1,2) - and there are 3 particles:
	
		012

	0	010
	1	101
	2	010



Misc
	- was getting weird segfault with many particles. found out that it was due to
	num_particles^2 overflowing int. num_particles^2 is the max number of collisions
		- fixed by changing ints to unsigned int to give more space. 

Dependencies:
	Python:
		- matplotlib
